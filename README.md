# BookSearch

The purpose of this exercise is to explore your comfort building an output interface while working with a 3rd-party API. Specifically, you'll be building a small book listing webapp using either vanilla HTML/CSS/JS or your front-end framework of choice.

Please fork the following CodePen to get started: https://codepen.io/dotdash/pen/eEwwRZ 

Your application should be composed of a simple search box that upon enter or click of the "Search" button, triggers a search using a (provided) REST endpoint which proxies Goodreads' public APIs, transforms it into JSON, and adds CORS headers for client-side use. The results of the API call should be displayed in your app.
